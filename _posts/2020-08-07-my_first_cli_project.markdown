Its easy to feel the presence of procrastination when faced with the unknown of a daunting project, but I felt the exact opposite. I was eager to take what I had learned from the labs about the fundamentals and scraping and apply it to build my very own CLI. I was definitely nervous because going from labs where they lay out certain methods to help out in the build of a class to a completely blank slate and having to figure out where to start. This project was certainly a challenge that tested every aspect of what you learned.

At the start I had a few ideas on what I wanted my project to be about, the first was a website that had local events in my city. Second, was a similar website that had local events but the layout of the page itself was different. My third idea was a website that sold hemp and cbd products. I was already set on scraping instead of getting an API for the information I needed. So I started by checking to see how hard these websites were going to be to scrape and I found out pretty soon that my first two ideas were a no go. That left me with no choice but to go with my third idea, however as I inspected the website I realized that scraping it was going to be fairly easy.

Stubbing out my CLI and figuring out how I wanted my user to interact with the my app was the easy part. I used fake data in the beginning just so I would know if my CLI was working. After working through errors and moving some things around, I proceded to the website to scrape for the real data I would need in order to create objects. Now this is where I ran into a little trouble, once I had the data I needed to create new objects I had to associate the objects and establish a belongs-to relationship. It took a lot of research and looking back at old labs to remember how to create the relationship between my objects. All in all this was a really great first project and by pulling all the fundamentals together to create something that someone can interact with also helped me understand everything that we had learned thus far!
