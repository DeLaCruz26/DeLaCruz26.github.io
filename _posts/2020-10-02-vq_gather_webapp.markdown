My very first webapp! Challenging but fun, I learned a lot on this second project and by a lot I mean don't try to bite off more than you can chew! I started this project with a clear idea of what I was going to build. My sister has this small startup business and my goal was to create a simple webapp for her! Needless to say that turned out to be a bigger challenge than I was prepared for, so back to the drawing board I went! 

I am a car enthusiast so a lightbulb went off in my head, I got it! I was going to build a car meetup webapp or a "vq gather" site where a user can signup and register there vq and also see other users vq's. For those who are not car enthusiasts, vq is the type of engine for the nissans 350z, 370z, 400z also the infiniti g35, g37 and so on.

After I knew what I was going to build, I got to work! I had a pretty good idea how I wanted the user to interact with my webapp. The hardest part was trying to figure out how I wanted the flow of the webapp to be, not to mention the style I was going for as well. All in all I learn a great deal from this experience and I am ready to take what I know, add some more knowledge to that and build bigger and better webapps!
