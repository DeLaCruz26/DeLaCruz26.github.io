Here I am, at the end of my software engineering journey, somewhere I thought wouldn't be so soon. Its a good feeling to know that I finally put my mind to something and acomplished it. For me this is a change in careers which I can honestly say that I am nervous about.

My journey so far has been one crazy emotional ride. It was a tough one, especially when you work full time, and married with three kids. Finding the time and keeping that scheduled time was a huge challenge I had to face, but with the support of my cohort I made that happen. Speaking of my cohort, I am extremely grateful for soe of the students that I have met  and worked along side with. Having someone who is in the predicament as you helps out tremendously and really puts you back into reality of thinking that you are in this alone.

I will say that towards the end of this course I was struck with imposter syndrome, which still effects me as I am writing this blog. Imposter syndrom is a temporary feeling if you can push through it, once you keep pushing some of the material that gave you imposter syndrome will slowly start to click. Having that feeling though is and was a new emotion I have never felt before. When it first hit me I was really close to giving up because I though I would never understand the material. What helped me cope with the feeling was talking to other students who were feeling the exact same way that I was. It just goes to prove that no matter situation you are in, you are not alone!
