I am going to be honest here, when we first went into JavaScript I was excited to learn it on the simple fact that JavaScript is a pretty common language for most prgrammers to know. But, to my surprise, as the lessons moved along I felt as if I wasn't moving along with the lessons. The lessons seem to pass me by without my mind retaining much of what I either just learned or read. So it is safe to say that JavaScript through me for a doozy in the beginning.

However, once I crammed my brain with all the information I could my brain slowly started to pick up on this very popular language. Especially when this project started I had a good idea in my head. I was going to build a block breaker clone. It didn't take long for me to realize that it was actually a little bit more difficult than I thought. I was using html:5 and canvas, but for some odd reason I could not for the life of me get anything to draw on the canvas that I created and selected. I looked up documentation after documention to get a grasp on what I was missing. After literally days of reading and coding, still nothing on my canvas. I eventually came to my own conclusion that it may be a rails thing that won't allow canvas and/or the draw( ) method to work. 

My block breaker clone was broke before it was even fixed. I soon gave up on that idea and moved on to plan for something else. That is when I decided to go for a simple note or todo single page app. Either the first week of building our projects wasn't meant to be or I had some bad juju somewhere because, as I am building out my todo app I started having trouble with my terminal and git. When I went to git add, git commit, anything and everything I put inside the quotes of my commit was deleting all my files in my local repo. So it was back to googling and reading trying to figure out where I had messed up. 

Couple more days go by and now I am starting to get nervous about completing my project in enough time. It was then time to go back to making clone of a game, this time it was a memory game. I guess I should've went with this idea from the start, I've already seen many programmers have a go on this game with there own style. All-in-all, this was a great learning experience and fun to code and see this memory game come together in a working single page app. Now its time for React!
