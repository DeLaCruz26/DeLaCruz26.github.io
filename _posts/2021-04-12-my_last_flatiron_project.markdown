Its surreal to think that I have made it to the last project for Flatiron School but here I am. When I tell you that the word stress does not do it justice for the amount of stress I was really feeling during this whole project. For starters I was so undecisive on what I wanted to do for my final project, I had already started quite a few side projects that I wanted to use for my final project, but I eventually settled on a app for those who love to collect shoes. 

For this project, it was simple in a way because I didn't have any users to sign in plus I did not implement jwt or any other authentication. Once you went to the home page of my app you will see links to see all the sneakers in a collection and you are also able to create or add sneakers to the collection. What brought my whole app together was the use of certain technologies such as, createStore, which was used to set up redux and have all global state in one file. Connect was another piece of tech that I added, which allows me to map state and map dispatch to the redux store. Some challenges that I faced while building this project was understanding component lifecycles and getting the flow of props for parents to children. 

All-in-all, this is one project that I was excited about building because it gets me one step closer to the end goal of becoming a Software Developer. There is still a good bit of work that needs to be done in order for my app to be fully functional with no bugs, but with the knowledge that I have gained from being apart of Flatiron I know that my app will be production ready.
