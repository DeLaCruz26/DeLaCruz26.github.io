Throughout this whole project, especially from the start of the project, I spent a lot of time that was wasted trying to figure out the which routes I wanted to be nested within another route. As well as how I wanted my models to be associated. Before I started this project I had did some planning for these two issues I faced, but once I started thats when the confusion set in. I felt like what I had planned wasn't what I was actually going for, so that is when I started to change things around and one day of figuring out my nested routes turned into two and three days of switching routes back and forth. The same went for the associations in my models, finding my join table was the death of me. My models got switched around so many times, that is when I knew I had to go back to the drawing board.

After the first week gone, I finally understood how I wanted my routes to look and with due date creeping up on me it was time to buckle down and get my backend finished. Not going to lie I was nervous on all of the projects so far but this one really made me scratch my head. I kept drawing blank after blank and the feeling of not completed it on time started to settled in. When I would go and read documentation or watch a video of some one explaining  nested routes and associations, I felt like it worked for them but not for me.

I will say about a couple days before the due date I spent hours on slack calls with others form my cohort and we all would focus on ones project and go back and forth sharing screens and worked on it as a team. Doing those slack calls is what saved me, if it had not been for the guys that are so willing to help, probably wouldn't had submitted my project on time. So in the end, if you are stuck on pretty much anything, always ask for help. The person you ask will always see things in a different perspective. Having the community that Flatiron provides is the best thing for all of us pursuing Software Development to utilized and not be shy to ask because most likely there is a few others having the same issue.
