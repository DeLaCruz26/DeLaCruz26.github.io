I've always been the how-to guy. The Mr. Fix It, the wanna know how, the get to the nitty gritty of how things work. The nuts and bolts so to speak. Software Engineering holds that same weight. I want to know how it works behind the scenes. The day I decided to study Software Engineering was the day I realized that it could change my life and the future. 

Since I was a young boy, I didn't mind spending my free time disassembling a VHS player just to reassemble it as soon as I finished. Now, I can't say all my attemps weren't successful and I'm pretty sure my parents had a lot of "WTF" moments, but hey, at least I tried. Learning the ins, outs and in-betweens of Software Engineering is so appealing. I want to be able to develope and design dope apps and websites. I aspire to develope the 'next big thing' that could potentially better someone's day-to-day life whether that be something to the likes of Venmo or Flappy Birds.

Now that I've told you a little about my childhood, let me catch you up to date with where I am at the moment. As I sit typing this blog, I have a rambunctious three year old jumping on loose couch cusions and a crying one year old begging for my pregnant wife's attention. To study Software Engineering is to learn a skill that will be a necessity for future generations. This is something I would love to pass on to my three children so that they may, too, become Software Engineers if they choose to be. 

To say I don't dream of a day where I have a drink in my hand and my toes in the sand while simultaneously working my "9 to 5" would be a lie. I am determined to have the freedom and flexibility to work anywhere in the world while spending more quality time with my family. My plan is to become a freelancing Software Enginer whom is versatile in many programming languages. 

Overall, I decided to study Software Engineering for myself, my family, and the future. The future is in our hands afterall, or should I say... our fingertips!
